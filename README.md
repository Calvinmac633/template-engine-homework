## User Story
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## Installation

npm install
npm install inquirer
npm install require

## Usage
Start by running "npm install" in the command line. This will install necessary json packages.

Then, run "node app.js" in the command line to start the application.

Follow the prompts and fill out information to build your team. Note: there is a maximum of 6 people to a team. So after
the 6th person as been entered the program will stop. 

Once you are done, open the "team.html" file located in the output directory.
